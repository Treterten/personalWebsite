          {` I think that one of the most important aspects of tackling challenges is to find a way or make one. I've developed a stick-to-itiveness from a young age when it came to software engineering, as I wanted to make video game mods when I was 11. In high school, I led a programming club that participated in hackathons and created applications for clients. For our apps, I was a project manager and we utilized php and MySql to create full stack apps. When I moved on from high school, I was involved as a full-stack engineer for applications that used technologies including TypeScript, React, Amazon Web Services, MongoDB, and a wide variety of others.
          When I'm not programming, I'm usually taking hikes outside or going for a run with some friends, or maybe even practicing guitar! I also enjoy  learning about political theory and philosophy, or just relaxing with a good video game.`}
